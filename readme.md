# Coffee shop ordering API

Spring Boot + Kotlin

## Getting Started

Check the [basic design](https://docs.google.com/a/dius.com.au/document/d/1s9jNOQtfjHfah_io6iCLmjexcaFs4Fr_KsK553N8TZs/edit?usp=sharing).

I have `gradle` installed via [SDK Man](http://sdkman.io/), could add a `gradlew` instead maybe?

```
> gradle build                                                # to build and run tests
> java -jar build/libs/dius-mentor_boris_coffee-api-0.1.0.jar # to run the app (with colours!)
> gradle bootRun                                              # to run the app (without colours)
```
